      As a software engineer, I enjoy bridging the gap between code and applications &mdash; combining my technical knowledge
      with my meticulous intellect for problem solving to create a beautiful product. My goal is to build applications and provide solutions
      that are efficient under the hood and scalable for billions while providing engaging enhanced user experience and life.

      <strong>When I'm not in front of a computer screen</strong>, I'm probably playing board games, reading a book, binge-watching or crossing off another item on my bucket list.
